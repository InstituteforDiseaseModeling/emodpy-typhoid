# Blantyre Scenario & Workflow

## Purpose

The goal of this example is to recreate: https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/ESEcon

But without the enviro surveillance part.

Some highlights of the ESEcon scenario:
- TBD

The COMPS run of this is here:

https://comps.idmod.org/#explore/Simulations?filters=ExperimentId=1b1a1c02-5c97-e911-a2c1-c4346bcb1555&offset=0&count=100&selectedId=e2670e14-5c97-e911-a2c1-c4346bcb1555&mode=list&resizer=502C502C0

Except there are some differences (TBD).

Some notes on the COMPS version:
- The COMPS run goes from 1917 to 2039
- There is a t=1 seeding of 50% and 10 years of annual 0.5% seeding.
- Typhoid Vaccines are introduced in 2017 (100 years in) to 85% of 9-month-olds.
- The initial age is exponential.
- The fertility is "high" fro 1917 to 1960, then goes down to a low modern value.
- Mortality is realistic for early years and constant across the sim.
- The net population has a nice realistic "sigmod" pattern with cresting in near future.
- The prevalence is low and steadily rising across the latter part of the sim.
